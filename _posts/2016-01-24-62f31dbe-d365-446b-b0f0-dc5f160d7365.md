**Perhaps we expect too much (excerpts 1) by Eric Williamson**
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/558480a6b92be3a590a389c03c281940260bf257.jpg)

When we breathe   
We breathe memory 

The past is our world 

We cannot escape our fears   
We meander the deals 

A blip of consciousness   
On the sea of time 

These limitations define us --   
What are we willing to say?   
What are we willing to do? 

Our greatest challenge   
May be to face the sadness   
That this knowledge entails 

We are better.   
This test most will fail 

The blip gasps for air   
This, this now, this is all we have 

And yet tonight   
A father, felt rage   
For bringing his son   
Into such the terrible place 

Where there are things with teeth and where there are things with talons   
We must breathe 

(c) Eric Williamson
