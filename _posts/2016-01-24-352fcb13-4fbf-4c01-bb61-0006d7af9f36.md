Late Night Drive by Eric Williamson

She will be blacked out,   
a bombshell,   
and doesn't say anything all the way home. 

Her tender skin beaten and strewn,  
highlighted and dog-eared,   
like a good text
or a lifetime commitment. 

A little more is taken each day. 

Her tears remain silent and clear.   
It's part of a cycle, this fading away,
  
the late night drive inside. 

She remembers: his fist like dynamite
  
wedged between her teeth. 

She reflects: floss snapping, minty and fresh. 

She recalls: folded spring dried laundry
  
upon her knee and pressed panties to her lips... 

...Dreams that scatter like dandelions on her breath,
  
like cockroaches in the kitchen dark turned light. 

The days are never meant to last
  
as night drives by her old house,
  
Another year unfulfilled. It has been so long. 

She hears sirens and blinks,
  
trying to touch her nose
  
with her tongue. 

Goodnight silk sky.
  
Dark. Soft. Good and gone.
